Cardio.ipynb consists of code wherein I have used regression techniques to predict Heart Disease. The steps which I have performed include
Data Understanding
Data Preprocessing
Data Modeling
Fitting the Model

cardio_train.csv is the Dataset.

## Python Libraries Used.
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn

## Data Understanding
## What is the age range which is suffering from Heart Disease??
We can see from the plot that the people in the age range of 52–62 are more prone to heart disease expect we can see a slight decline in the age range of 56–60
