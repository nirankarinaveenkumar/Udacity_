# How to predict if a person has a Heart Disease or not using Machine Learning

Heart Diseases can be predicted using different factors such as age, height, weight, gender, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure,
cholesterol, glucose, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity. The link to the dataset can be found here.

Cardio.ipynb consists of code wherein I have used regression techniques to predict Heart Disease. The steps which I have performed include

Data Understanding
Data Preprocessing
Data Modeling
Fitting the Model

cardio_train.csv is the Dataset.

## Python Libraries Used.
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn

## Data Understanding
## What is the age range which is suffering from Heart Disease??
We can see from the plot that the people in the age range of 52–62 are more prone to heart disease expect we can see a slight decline in the age range of 56–60

## Who is more susceptible to having a heart disease. Male or Female?
We can see from the plot that the males have a higher percentage than those of women. Males are more susceptible to heart diseases.

## Does smoking have any effect on Heart Disease??
Here we can see a different trend that those people who used to smoke are not much susceptible to heart diseases.


## Conclusion
Hence we can predict if a person has heart disease or not by applying machine learning techniques.
